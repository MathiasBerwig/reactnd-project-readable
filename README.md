# Readable API Server

This is my project for the final assessment project for Udacity's Redux course. The aim of the project is to build a content and comment web app. Users are able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users also are be able to edit and delete posts and comments.

This repository includes code for the backend API Server provided by Udacity and the front-end portion of the project.
